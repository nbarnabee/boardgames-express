# boardgames-express

A heavily commented practice project.  

Live on Heroku at [Boardgame Collection](https://boardgame-collection.herokuapp.com/)


To use this on your own computer, download the files and unzip them, or fork this repo into your own and clone it onto your machine.

Open a terminal window, navigate to the file directory and enter `npm install` You'll also need to set up your own DB and either hardcode your login credentials into the `server.js` file or create a new `.env` file and enter your connection string there.

Once all that is done, simply type `npm start` in your terminal and open a browser window to `http://localhost:5000`

Instructions on how to set up MongoDB can be found on [Zell Liew's blog](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/#mongodb), and an explanation of .env files can be found in the documentation for [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
